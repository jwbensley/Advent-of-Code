# Naming

This goal of this repo is to store variations of correct solutions to the 2021 problems. Multiple solutions and/or variations of the same solution may exist, for a given challenge of a given day. The idea is to try different ideas (both good and bad) to learn, not just to provide one single working solution.

Files are named: `YYYY-MM-DD-T_VVV.py`

YYYY == Year  
MM == Month  
DD == Day  
T == Which of the two daily challenges this is, 1 or 2  
VVVV == Solution variation; 001, 002, 003 are variations of the same solution. 011, 012, 013 are variations of a different solution. 021, 022, 023 are another set.
