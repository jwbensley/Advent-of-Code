# Naming

N.B: most of these solutions here are in a "code golf" style, meaning the challenge is to write fewer lines of code, not good code!

This repo stores variations of solutions to the 2023 AoC problems. Multiple solutions and/or variations of the same solution may exist for a given challenge. The idea is to try different ideas (both good and bad) to learn, not just to provide one single working solution.

Files are named: `YYYY-MM-DD-T-VVV.py`

YYYY == Year  
MM == Month  
DD == Day  
T == Which of the two daily challenges this is, because some days are multi-part challenges
VVVV == Solution variation; 001, 002, 003 etc.
